# EPL Predictive Analytics Project

This repository hosts the **CIND820 Capstone Project** focusing on predictive analytics for English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes.

## Project Goal
To determine the factors (match stats, home/away advantage, recent form vs. historical average) that most strongly influence EPL match results using advanced machine learning models (XGBoost).

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and iterative modeling notebooks.
- `src/`: Reusable Python functions for cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- `reports/`: Final visualizations, model interpretation outputs (SHAP), and project reports.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks starting with `notebooks/01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`.
